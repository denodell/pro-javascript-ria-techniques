<!-- We specify the custom SVG DOCTYPE above to add tag support -->

<!-- First, we define a canvas to draw upon, using the <svg> tag -->
<svg width="1024" height="768" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

    <!-- Define a gradient - this wonâ€™t be displayed yet, just defined. x1 and y1 denote 
         the position where the gradient will begin and x2 and y2 - denote where the 
         gradient will end. The colors used and at which points along the gradient they 
         change are denoted by the <stop> tags within the <linearGradient> tag -->
    <linearGradient id="gradient" gradientUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x1="0" y1="0" x2="200" y2="0">
        <stop offset="0" stop-color="#000000" />
        <stop offset="1" stop-color="#cccccc" />
    </linearGradient>

    <!-- Draw a square, beginning at the location denoted by x and y. Fill its
         contents with the gradient defined previously, referenced by its id -->
    <rect x="20" y="20" width="200" height="200" fill="url(#gradient)" />

    <!-- Draw a rectangle at position x, y with rounded corners, whose radius
         is denoted by the rx and ry attributes. Note the use of the style attribute
         which applies styles to the element as it would within XHTML -->
    <rect x="220" y="220" rx="20" ry="20" width="250" height="100" style="fill:#330000;"/>

    <!-- Draw a circle, with the radius denoted by the attribute r. We define a 
         border around the circle using the stroke and stroke-width attributes -->
    <circle cx="350" cy="120" r="50" stroke="#336699" stroke-width="25" fill="#003300" />

    <!-- Draw a line from the position x1, y1 to the position x2, y2. You would
         not actually see the line until you applied a stroke-width border to it,
         which we do here by means of the style attribute on the <line> tag -->
    <line x1="20" y1="20" x2="320" y2="320" style="stroke:#cccccc;stroke-width:3"/>

    <!-- Write text on the canvas in a fixed size and color -->
    <g font-size="50" font-weight="bold" fill="#333333">
        <text x="200" y="460">Text Example</text>
